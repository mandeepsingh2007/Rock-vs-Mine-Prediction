Rock vs Mine Prediction ML System
📖 Overview
This project implements a machine learning predictive system that classifies geological samples as either rock or mine based on sonar signal data. The system uses logistic regression for prediction, providing a simple yet effective solution for binary classification.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
numpy for numerical operations
pandas for data manipulation
scikit-learn for machine learning
Dataset: Sonar Data (UCI Repository)
🧪 Model Workflow
Data Loading:
The sonar dataset is loaded and split into features (X) and labels (Y).

Data Splitting:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets (90% training, 10% testing) using stratified sampling to maintain class balance.

Model Training:
Logistic Regression is trained on the training dataset.

Model Evaluation:

Training data accuracy is calculated to assess model fit.
Testing data accuracy is calculated to evaluate model performance on unseen data.
Prediction:
The model predicts whether a given input data sample corresponds to a rock or a mine.
🧪 Example Results
Training Accuracy: 83.5% (example value)
Testing Accuracy: 76.0% (example value)
📜 Future Enhancements
Add support for additional classification algorithms for comparison.
Visualize the dataset and results using matplotlib or seaborn.
Deploy the model as a web application using Flask or Streamlit for user interaction.
