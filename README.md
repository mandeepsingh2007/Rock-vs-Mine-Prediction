**🌍 Rock vs Mine Prediction ML System**

**📖 Overview**

This project implements a machine learning predictive system that classifies geological samples as either rock or mine based on sonar signal data.
The system uses Logistic Regression for prediction, providing a simple yet effective solution for binary classification.


**🛠️ Technologies Used**

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:
numpy for numerical operations

pandas for data manipulation

scikit-learn for machine learning

Dataset: Sonar Data (UCI Repository)

**🧪 Model Workflow**

**Data Loading**

The sonar dataset is loaded and split into features (X) and labels (Y).
**Data Splitting**

The dataset is split into training and testing sets (90% training, 10% testing) using stratified sampling to maintain class balance.

**Model Training**

Logistic Regression is trained on the training dataset.

**Model Evaluation**

Training Data Accuracy: To assess model fit.
Testing Data Accuracy: To evaluate model performance on unseen data.

**Prediction**

The model predicts whether a given input data sample corresponds to a rock or a mine.

**🧪 Example Results**

**Training Accuracy: 83.5% **

**Testing Accuracy: 76.0% **

**📜 Future Enhancements**

Add support for additional classification algorithms for comparison.

Visualize the dataset and results using matplotlib or seaborn.

Deploy the model as a web application using Flask or Streamlit for user interaction.
